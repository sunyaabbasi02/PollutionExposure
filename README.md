In this project, I want to look at how exposure to pollution burdens different communities 
and its harmful effects in California. First, I will perform Exploratory Data Analysis and clean 
data from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the 
2019 American Community Survey from the Census Bureau. I will use these two datasets to create 
visualizations comparing pollution burden and asthma emergencies across California's
racial groups.

Then, I take a sample of 300 rows from my DataFrame and perform A/B testing to see 
if there is a difference in the distribution of emergency asthma visits per 10,000 people 
for people living in areas with low versus high pollution levels.

This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning and analysis using python, pandas, seaborn,
and my statistical knowledge of A/B testing.
